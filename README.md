# Work-In-Progress
I am learning to write code.
In the first section of this project I learned what HTML is and how it functions as part of a web page.
A few things I learned were how to make URLs open in another tab (which I prefer, but know that it isn't necessary), I also learned about the importance of folders, files and tyeir relationship to links and how the links are embedded in the website.
